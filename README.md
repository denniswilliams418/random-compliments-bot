# random-compliments-bot
A Python script to act as a Twitter bot that tweets out random compliments to my girlfriend.

Makes use of Twython â€“ a Twitter library that allows developers to connect their Python apps to Twitter.

This bot can be hosted on a Raspberry Pi and scheduled to run automatically using Cron.
